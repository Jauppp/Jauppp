## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Coralie

I am a former makeup artist who started studying programming at 26. I care about open-source software, ethical technology and gender equality in STEM.

I enjoy spending hours gnawing on a problem until it's not a problem anymore.

I am currently studying at 42Lyon, where I am a student representative, tutor and ambassador.

  <summary>My journey</summary>
  
  - **2024**: currently studying the common core at 42.
  - **2023**: started playing around with lower level language (C). Took the piscine at 42Lyon and got in!
  - **2022**: realised the career I had chosen was not for me and decided to explore alternative career paths. Remembered the fun I had programming and started seriously considering that path.
  - **2021**: managed WordPress and Shopify supported websites as part of my jobs as a production assistant for a YouTube channel.
  - **2020**: graduated from my degree. Covid hit, cancelling the festival I was supposed to intern at. As a replacement, made a website for a photographer friend using a tailored WordPress template.
  - **2019**: discovered HTML, CSS, and WordPress. Also a lot of fun.
  - **2018**: started experimenting with Excel formulas and VBA to exploit data for studies conducted in the scope of my degree. I had *a lot* of fun.
  - **2017**: went back to school to study cultural management.
  - **2015**: started my career as a MakeUp artist for TV and cinema.
